5b543c20ac5a159c9941f5ec8c805ba6.txt:<div class="interviewee"><b>[A]CT:</b> You've got to remember, Mike, excuse me for interjecting this, but you have to remember that years before people who came into this field, years before they knew anything about theory or harmony, composition, counterpoint, etc., they gave in to their feelings. And they were indulging in, for lack of a better term they called it "get off. " This is long before the term "improvisation" was coined, you know before it was in the dictionary, pertaining to playing music you know. They used to call it "get off," which simply meant that the first chorus you played a melody, and thereafter you'd use the melody as a guidewire to simply superimpose extemporaneously a melody around this given melody. So that's what it became "get off", so you "get off" the melody. Even then the guys were giving vent to their feelings and expressing themselves and they would use certain things that would help them get from point A to point B. First of all the one thing that we teach our students today, and I'm sure you do too, regardless of how much theory or harmony or counterpoint or composition will get in their brain, they've got to know when to use it. They've got to listen for when to use it. Or how to use it. But there's a zillion educated fools walking around the street today. Heads loaded with something they don't know how to use it, don't know where to use it or when to use it. So this is a lesson that we try real hard to get our students to understand. <span class="otherMatch" rel="popover" id="other_606_95829">Back</span> in those days, they didn't know anything as you mention about these technical terms. They had nobody around to teach it. But they were determined to give in to their feelings and express themselves, and "get off. " So what'd they do? They played the <span class="otherMatch" rel="popover" id="other_610_96462">Blues</span> as the main vehicle, they played the Blues, and they played the standard tunes, and then superimposed melody around it. But on the <span class="otherMatch" rel="popover" id="other_611_96620">Blues</span> they figured out a good way to give vent to their feelings is that somebody had to change the melody, even without knowledge, to figure out, there's the tonic, that's the one; then you go up the scale, one two three, that's the third, they'd lower that a half- step, that's the minor third; you go up one, two, three, four, five, lower that, so you've got a tonic, a minor third, a flatted fifth, and they didn't know then that it constituted a half diminished. They couldn't care less, you know. All they knew is they called them the "blue notes. " "Man you've got your blue notes? " "<span class="partialMatch" rel="popover" id="partial_617_286">Yeah</span>, baby I've got `em down, I'm working on F sharp now, but I'm going to have that tomorrow. " But they looked at them as the blue notes. And right today, you take a class, and you take your rhythm section or your just play the bass along and tell them to play one note. [scats] Any kind of rhythmic pattern they want. Then the next, you tell them to take the two notes, the tonic and the minor third [scats], then the next time, take the flatted fifth and the minor third [scats].  Now you can't pick out more beautiful and important notes in playing the <span class="otherMatch" rel="popover" id="other_620_98042">Blues</span> than those three. Then you go into your seventh. And pretty soon they reach the point where it's almost -- we use this for discipline, too. That's all. Just that one note, those two notes or those three. Because after a while they begin to hear all of the relative notes that constitute the scale, you know, and then they're going to hear the four, they're going to hear the flat five, some people call it the augmented seventh the flat sixth, the major seventh, the nine, the flat nine, the thirteen, and all of them, they'll hear the whole scale then. But after a while, for a period of time, they're going to be involved with playing those blue notes. The blue notes. The tonic, minor third and the flatted fifth, and they got it. And if you find a cat whose pretty well endowed in playing the blues with those three things in mind, he'll listen to these things, all these things. </div>

So I'll do that, and then my band, we play "Nobody Knows..." and the band's still playing behind me, and I'll talk about life under slavery. And I usually say that I don't know what slavery is like. I'm standing up here in an <span class="otherMatch" rel="popover" id="other_463_35706">Italian</span> suit and with my gold rings on and stuff, so you know I'm a long way from a slave, but in order to know my history I went to the library to read books about it. And there was one book that I related to. There was one instance in a book that I related to. And I'll say you know slaves aren't supposed to learn to read or write, yet there was one man born in slavery who became so proficient at it until he became editor of a newspaper and that was Frederick Douglas. Now see in his book he said at one time, he had a chance to see his, he only got a chance to see his mother seldom in his life. And he had to walk twenty miles in darkness each time. So I said well for me, how I relate to that is my dad died when I was seven so my mother was my mentor. And every time I needed to know something I'd go and my mother would tell me. I even went and said can I go traveling on the road at sixteen. And she was always there for me. So I said slavery for me would have been not to have access to my mother or freedom or anything. But I really would relate to that part of it.

I guess I was 16. I was close to 17 because I was almost ready to graduate from high school.

It looked like a checkerboard, one of those checkerboard suitcases with the strap that went around the center of it you know? And my father told me all of the things to look out for on the road. How to act like I was smoking reefer and not really be smoking reefer. How to always keep my bus fare home. All of these things he told me about. Everything he told me about I ran into. And he was like that.

But by that time I had been with <span class="fullMatch" id="match_58">Gene Ammons</span> and <span class="fullMatch" id="match_54">Sonny Stitt</span>, I was with <span class="fullMatch" id="match_55">Sarah Vaughan</span>, I'd been with <span class="fullMatch" id="match_56">Dakota Staton</span> and I was with <span class="fullMatch" id="match_57">Nancy Wilson</span>.
